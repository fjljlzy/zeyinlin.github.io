# About me

I am a postgraduate student in Data-driven Modeling at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Before, I received my first M.Sc. degree in Data Science at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) in Jul 2021. I obtained the Bachelor degree in the School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University. 

My research interests are Natural Language Processing and its related applications, especially in sentence dependency parsing, text generation and knowledge graph.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV](https://fjljlzy.github.io/zeyinlin.github.io/files/CV_LinZeyin_2203.pdf).
